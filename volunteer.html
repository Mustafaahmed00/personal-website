        <h2><i>IEEE MIT Undergraduate Research Technology Conference (URTC '23)</i></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>My Research was in Autonomous Drone Delivery System - To Design and implement an autonomous drone system for delivering packages in urban environments, focusing on efficiency, safety, and compliance with aviation regulations.</li>
            <li>The Research mainly had 8 components, </li>
            <li>1. Hardware Selection and Customization </li>
            <li>2. Navigation and Path Planning</li>
            <li>3. Communication System</li>
            <li>4. Safety and Compliance</li>
            <li>5. Delivery System</li>
            <li>6. User Interface and Control</li>
            <li>7. Data Management and Analytics</li>
            <li>8. Testing and Deployment</li>
            <li>9. Scalability and Future Enhancements</li>

        <h2><i>JP Morgan - Code for Good Hackathon Event 2023</i></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>In the initial selection round of Code for Good 2023, I faced two coding challenges on the HackerRank platform, designed to evaluate my proficiency in handling strings, arrays, basic data structures, and collections.</li>
            <li>progressed to the second phase of the selection process: the Virtual Interview. Conducted through the HireVue platform, the interview format entailed responding to two behavioral questions via recorded videos, with a time limit of 2 minutes for each question. <br> During the interview, I articulated my career aspirations and ambitions, outlining my vision for professional growth and development. I conveyed my passion for the field and highlighted specific goals I aim to achieve in the short and long term.</li>
            <li>Making it to the third round meant diving into a 24-hour hackathon. In this stage, participants were tasked with developing a solution tailored for a nonprofit organization, with the flexibility to choose between frontend or backend web technologies based on personal preference.</li>
            <li>I selected HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as my tools for frontend development, with the goal of crafting a tailored solution that meets the specific needs of the nonprofit organization within the 24-hour hackathon timeframe.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><i>Be MY Eyes</i></h2>
        
        <ul>
            <li>I volunteered with Be My Eyes, an organization that connects blind and low-vision 
                people with sighted volunteers through a mobile app for real-time visual 
                assistance.</li>
            <li>As a volunteer, I provided descriptions and guidance via video calls, 
                helping users with tasks and navigation, thus fostering greater independence.</li>
            <li>This 
                experience deepened my empathy and understanding of the visually impaired 
                community's challenges, reinforcing the value of technology in creating a more 
                inclusive society.</li>
        </ul>
       <h2><i>Khan Academy</i></h2>
       <ul>
        <li>I am proud to have dedicated my time and skills as a Volunteer Contributor at Khan Academy, a renowned nonprofit organization committed to providing free, world-class education for anyone, anywhere. </li>
        <li>My work focused on developing accessible learning materials across a variety of complex topics, including Differential Equations, Calculus, General Relativity, Gravity, and Quantum Mechanics. By breaking down these advanced concepts into understandable segments, I aimed to simplify subjects often perceived as challenging and to inspire a passion for learning in students around the world.</li>
